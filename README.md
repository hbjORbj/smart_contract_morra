# Smart Contract Programming: Implementation of Morra on my own Ethereum smart contract (written in Solidity)

The contract should allow two players (A,B) to play a game of Morra at any point in time. Each player picks a number between 1-5 and also guesses which number their fellow player has picked. 
<br/>
<br/>

They both show their hands and, in case only player A guesses correctly, A wins and is rewarded x Ether, where x is the sum of the numbers both players picked (similarly if B wins). 
<br/>
<br/>

After the game ends, users should be able to initiate a new game on the same contract.
